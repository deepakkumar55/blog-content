### <mark>Project:- 4/500 Weather App Project</mark> [LiveRun](https://deepakkumar55.github.io/ULTIMATE-JAVASCRIPT-PROJECT/Basic%20Projects/3-weather_app)

## Description

This is a simple weather app that allows users to get current weather information for any location. The app uses an external weather API to fetch real-time weather data and displays it in a user-friendly interface. This project is ideal for learning how to work with APIs and building interactive web applications using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## Features

* **Real-time Weather Data**: Fetch and display current weather information for any location.
    
* **Search Functionality**: Allow users to search for weather information by city name.
    
* **Responsive Design**: Ensure the app works well on various devices, including mobile phones and tablets.
    

## Technologies Used

* **JavaScript**: For fetching data from the weather API and updating the DOM.
    
* **HTML**: For structuring the app's interface.
    
* **CSS**: For styling the app and making it responsive.
    

## Setup

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/deepakkumar55/ULTIMATE-JAVASCRIPT-PROJECT.git
    ```
    
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
    
    ```bash
    cd Basic Projects/3-weather_app
    ```
    
3. **Open**`index.html` in your web browser: You can open the `index.html` file directly in your web browser by double-clicking on it or by using a live server extension in your code editor (like Live Server for VSCode).
    
4. **Obtain an API Key**: Sign up for a free API key from a weather service provider, such as OpenWeatherMap.
    
5. **Add Your API Key**: Update the JavaScript file with your API key in the appropriate place.
