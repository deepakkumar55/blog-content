Creating a multi-page application in React is straightforward with the help of React Router. React Router is a powerful library that allows you to implement routing in your React apps. In this article, we'll walk through the steps to set up a multi-page application using React Router, covering the basic concepts and code examples to get you started.

### What is React Router?

React Router is a library that enables dynamic routing in your React applications. It helps you manage navigation and render different components based on the URL path. With React Router, you can create a seamless multi-page experience within a single-page application.

### Getting Started

#### 1\. Install React Router

First, you need to install React Router. Open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
npm install react-router-dom
```

#### 2\. Set Up Your Project Structure

Create a basic React project if you haven't already. Your project folder might look something like this:

```plaintext
my-app/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Home.js
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ About.js
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Contact.js
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ App.js
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.js
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ App.css
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

#### 3\. Create Components for Each Page

Create the components for each page of your application. For this example, we'll create `Home.js`, `About.js`, and `Contact.js` in the `components` folder.

**Home.js**

```jsx
import React from 'react';

function Home() {
  return <h1>Home Page</h1>;
}

export default Home;
```

**About.js**

```jsx
import React from 'react';

function About() {
  return <h1>About Page</h1>;
}

export default About;
```

**Contact.js**

```jsx
import React from 'react';

function Contact() {
  return <h1>Contact Page</h1>;
}

export default Contact;
```

#### 4\. Set Up Routing in `App.js`

Now, configure routing in your `App.js` file. Import the necessary components from `react-router-dom` and set up your routes.

**App.js**

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Routes, Link } from 'react-router-dom';
import Home from './components/Home';
import About from './components/About';
import Contact from './components/Contact';

function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <nav>
        <ul>
          <li><Link to="/">Home</Link></li>
          <li><Link to="/about">About</Link></li>
          <li><Link to="/contact">Contact</Link></li>
        </ul>
      </nav>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
        <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
        <Route path="/contact" element={<Contact />} />
      </Routes>
    </Router>
  );
}

export default App;
```

In this code:

* `BrowserRouter` (aliased as `Router`) is used to handle the routing.
    
* `Route` defines the path and component to render.
    
* `Routes` wraps multiple `Route` components.
    
* `Link` is used to create navigation links.
    

#### 5\. Add Some Basic Styling

You can add some basic styles to your `App.css` to make the navigation look better.

**App.css**

```css
nav {
  background-color: #333;
  padding: 10px;
}

nav ul {
  list-style: none;
  padding: 0;
}

nav ul li {
  display: inline;
  margin-right: 10px;
}

nav ul li a {
  color: white;
  text-decoration: none;
}

nav ul li a:hover {
  text-decoration: underline;
}
```

#### 6\. Run Your App

Finally, run your React app with the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

Open your browser and navigate to [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000). You should see your multi-page application with working navigation links.

### Conclusion

With React Router, building a multi-page app becomes a breeze. Youâ€™ve learned how to set up basic routing, create page components, and manage navigation. React Routerâ€™s flexibility and ease of use make it an essential tool for React developers, enabling you to build dynamic and user-friendly web applications.
