### <mark>Project:- 1/500 To-Do List Project</mark>

## Description

The To-Do List project is designed to help users efficiently manage their daily tasks. This project demonstrates how to build a simple yet functional application using fundamental web development technologies. It allows users to add, update, and delete tasks, making task management straightforward and intuitive.

## Features

* **Add New Tasks**: Users can easily add new tasks by entering a task name and optional details in an input form. Each task is then added to the to-do list for tracking.
    
* **Mark Tasks as Complete**: Users can mark tasks as complete by clicking on them, which will visually differentiate completed tasks from those that are still pending.
    
* **Delete Tasks**: Users can remove tasks that are no longer needed by clicking a delete button, ensuring their to-do list remains clean and organized.
    

## Technologies Used

* **JavaScript**: Handles the dynamic aspects of the application, such as adding, updating, and deleting tasks.
    
* **HTML**: Provides the structure of the web page, including the form for adding tasks and the list for displaying them.
    
* **CSS**: Styles the application, ensuring it is visually appealing and responsive across different devices.
