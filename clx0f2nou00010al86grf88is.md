### <mark>Project:- 5/500 Firebase Authentication Project</mark>

## Description

Firebase Authentication provides a comprehensive and secure solution for authenticating users in web applications. It supports various authentication methods, including email and password, Google Sign-In, Facebook Login, and more. This project demonstrates how to integrate Firebase Authentication in a React application, offering a seamless and secure user login experience.

## Features

* **User Registration:** Allow users to sign up with email and password.
    
* **User Login:** Enable users to log in using their email and password.
    
* **Password Reset:** Provide users with the option to reset their password via email.
    

## Technologies Used

* **React:** For building the user interface.
    
* **Firebase:** For backend authentication services.

            apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
            authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
            projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
            storageBucket: "YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET",
            messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
            appId: "YOUR_APP_ID"
        };
        
        const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
        export const auth = getAuth(app);
        ```
