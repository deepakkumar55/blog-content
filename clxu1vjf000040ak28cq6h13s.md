### <mark>Project:- 10/500 Snake Game project.</mark>

## Description

The Snake Game is a classic arcade game where the player maneuvers a snake to collect food items. Each time the snake eats a piece of food, it grows longer, making the game progressively more challenging. The game ends when the snake runs into itself or the walls.

## Features

* **Simple Controls**: Navigate the snake using arrow keys.
    
* **Score Tracking**: Keep track of the player's score as the snake consumes food.
    
* **Increasing Difficulty**: The snake grows longer and moves faster with each food item consumed.
    

## Technologies Used

* **JavaScript**: For game logic and interactivity.
    
* **HTML**: To structure the game's layout.
    
* **CSS**: For styling the game interface.
